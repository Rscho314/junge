Junge
=====

A J-inspired funge
------------------

### What is Junge
Junge is an experimental programmming language trying to mix array and stack-based programming.
It is inspired by Befunge, J, and Smalltalk.

### What is Junge good for?
Presently absolutely nothing, and it has a huge chance of staying that way.
Ultimately, the idea is to combine 3 things:

- Functional array programming.
- Parallelism.
- A hopefully innovative programming environment.
